👋 I'm Léo Kosman, also known as Léo-21.

<hr>

I easily get interested by varied topics, so here are _some_ of my interests: 
- formal languages, functional programming and type theory;
- sequential logic, low-level programming and direct applications of physics to computer science;
- odd time signatures, polyrhythms, drums, metal and, more recently, music theory in general;
- aviation and paragliding.

I recently designed a 
[functional programming language featuring type inference](https://github.com/leo-210/typfun), built 
[a custom split keyboard](https://github.com/leo-210/lambda-keyboard) from scratch, and occasionally 
composed music.

I particularly enjoy combining different fields, such as math and music, by studying rhythms and applying 
them to my drumming.

I advocate for a free and open Internet: I contribute to FOSS projects, I use privacy-focused 
tools, and I take a critical stance toward new technologies. I am committed to using what influence
I have to build an open space for learning and sharing, a user-driven and sustainable Internet.
